= Cars Application

Work in Progress ...

== Pre-requisites
- https://github.com/minishift/minishift#[Minishift] - Kubernetes platform
- Use the https://github.com/minishift/minishift-addons/tree/master/add-ons/istio#[istio addon for minishift]
- https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] - will be used to parse JSON responses

== Download the sources 

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/kameshsampath/istio-keycloak-demo
----

We will call this folder as `$DEMO_HOME` in rest of the document.

== Deploying Keycloak

Since Keycloak will be used as security provider

[source,sh]
----
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/openshift-files/keycloak.yaml
----

To Open Keycloak WebConsole run the command `minishift openshift service keycloak --in-browser`

Using Keycloak WebConsole :

* Create a Keycloak realm called `istio`
* Create a public client called `cars-web` under realm `istio`
* Create a role `user` under realm `istio`
** Add a user say `demo`  under realm `istio` and add the user to `user` role

[NOTE]
====
* Keycloak is configured with default admin user `admin` and password `admin`
* Work in progress do the above steps via Keycloak Admin API automatically
====

== Building

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Since we will be doing manual kube-inject of Istio sidecars its required that you login to OpenShift as `admin`, to have permission
to lookup configmaps in other namespaces especially from istio-system
* oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n <your project>
====

[[cars-api]]
=== Cars API

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw -Distio.home=[your istio home folder] clean package fabric8:build <1>
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/cars-api/src/istio/istio-cars-api-0.0.1.yml <2>
----

<1> Build the app, create the kube-injected yaml and the docker image of the application
<2> Deploy the application to OpenShift

[[cars-api-auth-spec]]
=== Create Istio Authentication Spec and Binding

To configure the JWT-Auth Filter and the required cluster we need to configure Istio

[source,sh]
----
oc apply -f $DEMO_HOME/cars-api/src/istio/car-api-auth_config.yaml
----

The End user auth spec will add JWT-Auth filter to the Mixer config of the cars-api application
and add `keycloak` cluster to the CDS. Refer to <<query-istio>> section to know to query and check config

[[cars-api-mixer-rule]]
=== Create Istio mixer rule

Since we want to have only protected access to the application api `cars-api` list,  we need to add Istio mixer rule that will allow
only authorized users to access the API, the following command will help to create the rule,

[source,sh]
----
istioctl create -f $DEMO_HOME/cars-api/src/istio/mixer-rule-only-authorized.yaml
----

[[cars-web-app]]
=== Cars Web Application

NOTE: WIP post JWT-Auth change to configure the Keycloak Adapter url in a right way

[[testing-app]]
== Testing Application

[[testing-without-token]]
=== Without Token 

[source,sh]
----
curl -vvv $(minishift openshift service cars-api)/cars/list
----

Above command you should see a response like `UNKNOWN:handler.denier.default:Not Authorized` as the API
is protected

[[testing-with-token]]
=== With Token

[[testing-with-token-gen]]
==== Generate Token

[source,sh]
---
kubectl run -i --rm --restart=Never tokenizer --image=tutum/curl \
--command \
-- curl -X POST 'http://keycloak.istio-system:8080/auth/realms/istio/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d 'username={demo-user}&password={demo-user}&grant_type=password&client_id=cars-web' | jq .access_token 
---

The above command will output Authorization token from Keycloak, store the value in an environment variable called `$token`.

Once we have generated the token fire the command below with the token,

[source,sh]
----
curl -vvv -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" $(minishift openshift service cars-api)/cars/list
----

Above command you should see a response like `["BMW","Hyundai Verna","Audi","Ferrari"]`

[[query-istio]]
== Querying Istio

Istio LDS, CDS, SDS could be queried using the script available in https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/bin/istio-proxy-cfg

[[query-istio-lds]]
=== Querying LDS 

To Query https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/listeners/lds#[LDS] run the following command

[source,sh]
----
oc get pods <1>

istio-proxy-cfg lds sidecar <your pod id> <2>

minishift ssh <curl url from previous command> <3>
----
<1> find the pod id for cars-api
<2> this command will not succeed as the curl cant reach the istio from outside of minishift,
 by default we did not expose istio-pilot
<3> execute the curl command to see the LDS config

[[query-istio-cds]]
=== Querying CDS 

To Query https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/cluster_manager/cds#[CDS] run the following command

[source,sh]
----
oc get pods <1>

istio-proxy-cfg cds sidecar <your pod id> <2>

minishift ssh <curl url from previous command> <3>
----
<1> find the pod id for cars-api
<2> this command will not succeed as the curl cant reach the istio from outside of minishift,
 by default we did not expose istio-pilot
<3> execute the curl command to see the CDS config, you will see an extra cluster added
for keycloak based on the <<cars-api-auth-spec>>
